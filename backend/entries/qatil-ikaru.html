    Qatil Ikaru, more often referred to as simply Qatil, is the crowned prince of Ikarye, one of the six kingdoms that populate the continent of Cradia. Qatil’s parents are the king of Ikarye Sirus Ikaru, and the queen of Ikarye Zərərli Ikaru.Qatil is the primary protagonist of The Prince’s Truth.

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Qatil grew up mostly confined within castle walls, with only his twin sister Möhnət to keep him company. Interactions with his father were albeit brief but to his description “unnecessarily cruel”. These abusive moments for Qatil were only alleviated by his moments with his sister whom he came to treasure greatly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Qatil’s relationship with his mother was much better than his relationship with his father. Zərərli always doted on Qatil for the littlest things, always regarding him with the highest of expectations. Although for Qatil his mother’s behavior was always unsettling for him, and tended to avoid her growing up.
  </p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    In part 1 the story begins with Qatil being six years of age, thus his appearance was childlike, he had a short stature, a roundish and chubby like face, tan skin, short wavy black hair, and pure black irises. At such an age Qatil only adorned the prince’s royal garbs, this only changed when Qatil turned 14 and he dressed himself in an armored version of his usual royal garbs as he was preparing to set out for the first time outside of Ikarye.
  </p>
  <p>
    In part 2 Qatils appearance changes dramatically, in this stage of the story Qatil is much taller with much more defined features, and longer hair. Now that he had been pushed to venture out into the unknown and adventure the continent of Cradia, along with finally participating in the bloodshed of the Cradian World War he had gained a much more toned body type. Along his travels he had changed his outfit so that it would not resemble Cradians royal garbs as to not be noticed as a royal, replacing the pieces of clothing that were royal garbs with cloth and what would be considered peasant clothing, with colors varying from gray, brown, and a faded shade of red.
  </p>
  <p>
    In part 3 Qatil once again changes, now being ever so taller, with much longer hair, and a beefier body. His clothing remains the same throughout part 3 as it was in part 2, the only difference being that bits of his clothing now had scorch marks after the events of Canavar. While fighting Order in Günəş his Irises periodically turned a crimson red.
  </p>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Qatil has been a pessimist at birth and always found it difficult to find joy in many things. The only things in the world that seem to make Qatil genuinely happy are his friends. Being raised from birth in the pampering confines of a royal castle he was a spoiled child always yearning for more and more in his life, though his father always managed to humble him. In part 1 it is readily apparent that Qatil is very gullible, this is especially shown in his first interaction with Kira, showing immediate trust to a random lady he met in the woods.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also shown throughout the events of part 2 that Qatil tends to not eat much, his lack of appetite is due to his immense pessimism; he finds no need in ‘overeating’ even though he’s clearly undereating. While Qatil is usually lenient with his friends' antics he can also quickly become stern with them when the moment calls for it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall throughout the first 3 parts of The Prince’s Truth Qatil is a playful yet depressive character, that tends to have a bleak outlook yet is easily pulled into the graces of joy via people close to him. But above all if pushed close enough to the edge Qatil has been shown to absolutely snap and disregard the safety and well being of anyone around him all just to achieve a goal of revenge.
