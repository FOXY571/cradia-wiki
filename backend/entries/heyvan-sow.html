<h2>Backstory</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Pre Universal Destruction Heyvan's backstory is unknown. However, it is inferred that he grew up poor in Canavar without any family. Because of this, he resulted to stealing and robbery to make a living.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Post Universal Destruction Heyvan grew up with his older brother Kitab Sow in Canavar. While Heyvan was a baby, his parents were murdered by a sorcerer, forcing Heyvan and Kitab to make a living on their own. Heyvan saw his brother as his guardian and looked up to him. Unlike Kitab, who hated magic and sorcerers, Heyvan grew to love magic and was fascinated by sorcerers and their abilites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Heyvan and Kitab would visit a spot in Canavar that overlooked the sorcerer training grounds regularly. Although Kitab didn't enjoy going, he did it for his brother who he loved dearly. Heyvan would try to copy the sorcerers' moves with no luck, wondering if he could one day be a sorcerer himself. One day, Heyvan's luck turned around and he was able to cast some magic. This caused him and Kitab to be spotted by the training sorcerers. Spying on sorcerer training was strictly illegal in Canavar and the two boys were chased down by the sorcerers. Luckily, Heyvan managed to get away, yet his brother was caught and taken away.
  </p>
  <p>
    From then on, Heyvan lived on his own, practicing magic and using it to steal in order to get by alone. He also traveled to different kingdoms, growing a reputation for his skills in thievery and stealing. Through practice, he discovered shifting magic and used it to hide in plain sight, all the while his wanted level grew.
  </p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Heyvan Sow is a male caster with a tall, lanky build and white skin. He has short gray hair and green eyes. He jumps between outfits when shifting, yet most of the clothes he wears are rough, commoner outfits. Unlike most commoner clothes that are faint grays and browns, Heyvan likes to wear outfits with prominent black and red colors. His signature clothing items are a pair of black fingerless gloves and a black tophat with a feather sticking out of its band.
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to his shifting abilites, Heyvan has been seen to take on the forms of many animals including cats, birds, small critters, and more. Heyvan's signature form is that of a shorthair cat with gray fur and green eyes that has been named Tyger by one of his friends.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Due to his rough and challenging childhood, Heyvan has grown to distrust other people. This makes it harder for him to form relationships and bond with others. In contrast, Heyvan is unusually charismatic and excells in trickery and manipulation. However, he doesn't use his charisma to harm others and only uses it to steal and get people on his side. Heyvan also tends to lack empathy and compassion, not caring how the people around him feel. Although Heyvan acts brave around others, he can be seen as a coward in some scenarios that endager his life, especially combat.
  </p>
  <p>
    Pre Universal Destruction Heyvan has more of an egotistical personality in comparision to his Post Universal Destruction counterpart, who is more dismissive and aloof. Pre Universal Destruction Heyvan can be seen making fun at royals and enjoys pushing people's buttons. He is also always seen carrying a smirk on his face and believes he is better than others. Post Universal Destruction Heyvan is instead warry of others and prefers to be left alone. His distrust easily makes him snap back at others even when no ill intent was directed toward him. The differences in his personaility in the two universes are inferred to be different because of the differences in his backstories.
  </p>
