He is the first being to ever be created and created everything in the universe that existed pre Universal Destruction. The only things he did not create is anything derived of chaos. This includes chaos itself and <a href="?entry=qatil-ikaru" title="Qatil Ikaru">Qatil Ikaru</a>. Order is an enemy of <a href="?entry=kira-amaikoru" title="Kira Amaikoru">Kira Amaikoru</a> and seeks to bring her to justice and restore order to the universe.

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Order's backstory is told through <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/156tEg_gCU1lIk8yqMwPWvJ8fE2a_Ql3_OI6n4iYDIOs/edit?usp=sharing" title="The Birth of Order">"The Birth of Order"</a>, a story in an old religious book centered around worshipping Order. It describes Order being created by a big bang that was the result of chaos becoming infinitely dense. The chaos was then destroyed and all that existed in the universe was Order. The story then describes Order creating the world and everything on it, such as the humans, animals, and plants. Order created life and the world because he wanted to ascend someone to godhood.
  </p>
  <p>
    After a long period of time, Order decided to ascend <a href="?entry=kira-amaikoru" title="Kira Amaikoru">Kira Amaikoru</a>, a girl living in Canavar at the time. After she was ascended, Order gave her half of his power. Kira was greedy and wanted more of his power, so she took it all and sent him down to Cradia where he lost his godhood and became a <a href="?entry=species" title="Species">demigod</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since then, Order has been preparing to stop Kira and return order to the universe. He's done so by killing Kira worshippers and slowing the spread of her influence around Cradia. After Order discovered that <a href="?entry=qatil-ikaru" title="Qatil Ikaru">Qatil Ikaru</a> was working with Kira in <a href="?entry=the-prince's-truth" title="The Prince's Truth">The Prince's Truth</a>, he set out kill him next.
  </p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    Order is a tall male with light skin, black eyes, and brown hair. He isn't super muscular and is just slightly toned, however, this doesn't seem to affect his power. Order dresses in dark clothing and doesn't tend to wear shirts, preferring to have his upper body exposed. Order will sometimes wear cloaks to remain conspicuous. Additionally, he doesn't prefer wearing armor or heavy clothing items as he idolizes agility over endurance.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Personality</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    It is hard to tell what kind of personality Order has because he is very monotone. He rarley shows emotion and it is most likely because he doesn't deem it necessary. However, because he was once a God, Order is very wise. He is very good at picking up on his enemies' weaknesses and knows when to quit if he's lost. He prefers to get things over with and doesn't do something he believes is a waste of his time. He likes to get straight to the point and doesn't hold back.
  </p>
  <p>
    Order doesn't seem to have any empathy for the people of Cradia, his intentions to them being more indifferent. He doesn't have any issues killing and destroying if it means achieving what he deems necessary, however, he won't kill anyone if it doesn't serve a purpose. Some believe Order has a huge ego, yet Order doesn't believe highly of himself, he knows he's better than others because of what he's able to do.
  </p>
  <p>
    Order is driven by what he believes should be done to save the universe, which is stopping <a href="?entry=kira-amaikoru" title="Kira Amaikoru">Kira Amaikoru</a> and putting an end to chaos. He doesn't let anyone get in his way or try to stop him, and he will stop at nothing to achieve his goal.
  </p>
