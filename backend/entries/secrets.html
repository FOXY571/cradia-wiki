Relieved my friends were ok I came closer to Mona and kneeled down to her and asked “You know what’s crazy mona?” I paused for a bit to see if she’d know what I was talking about then finally spoke “That low taper fade meme is still massive, it’s massive Mona.” Heyvan then stood up looking down at me with a smirk and asked “And you know what else is massive?” and as if we were a church choir we all yelled out in synch “LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADE.” Suddenly the surviving people of the kingdom began to make a tribal chant as they heard our cry all saying “LOW TAPER FADE LOW TAPER FADE LOW TAPER FADE LOW TAPER FADE.” Suddenly a magical portal opened up and Walter H. White walked out and said “I am the danger.” Soon Miles Morales spiderman came out of the portal too and said “What’s up danger?” and finally the Fantastic Four came out of the portal and looked around, the thing then said “Wow this place is fantastic.” Then Mr. Fantastic turned to the thing and said “Say that again.” Finally Martin Scorsese came out of the portal and put his hands in the air and said “Absolute Cinema.”
