## History

<!-- Put the kingdom's history here -->
In the beginning Ikarye wasn't always Ikarye, decades ago it wasn't even ruled by Sirus Ikaru. Originally it was a kingdom called Rukaria, it was a kingdom renowned for their humanitarianism, it was fair to even it's peasants and was more than happy to assist any neighboring kingdom in need. However one day Sirus himself rebelled against the orginal monarchy, rallying fellow citizens claiming that the actions of the king made the kingdom look weak and vulnerable to attack, he claimed that instead of helping other kingdoms they should show their strength so that they may not be tested. As the rebellion went on eventually Sirus would be victorious, he would then executre the former king and banish his family thus becoming the new king of the now newly named Ikarye. From then on he had done what he promised giving Ikarye the reputation of a very aggressive and heartless stronghold. Instead of herbal trade routes they now produced a variety of battle hardened warriors and casters, eventually leading to Ikarye being the most feared kingdom in the world.
