# Magic

**Magic** is one of the main forms of combat in the Cradia series and is a key part of the storytelling found within the series. Magic can be used to do many different things such as fight, move obejcts, change the state or form of objects, and much more. There are multiple different types of magic, their only differences being how they are obtained and sometimes their level of power.

Every species from [caster](?entry=caster "Species") and above is able to use and control magic. It's impossible to use magic otherwise except through foregin methods that are rarely practiced and frowned upon by most sorcerers. As someone practices and uses magic, the color of their blood will slowly turn blue.

## Core Magic

Core magic is the most basic type of magic, yet that doesn't make it any worse than its counterparts as it can still be powerful. It is also the most common type of magic, used by almost all sorcerers in kingdoms' armies. This is because it is the easiest to learn and isn't derived by any other magic. Additionally, a core magic is needed first in order to practice another type of magic (this does not apply to divine magic).

A [caster](?entry=caster "Species") is able to choose any core magic that they wish to learn. They can also switch their chosen magic, but it becomes near impossible to do so when a they have gained a lot of experience it.

## Sub Magic

Sub magic is a form of magic that is derived from core magic, meaning it is a child of core magic. To practice sub magic, one will need to know the magic's core magic parent. For example, to practice ice magic, one will need to know water magic. Sub magic's abilities can range from fairley simple to very exotic. A [caster](?entry=caster "Species") that uses a sub magic can also use the core magic that it is derived from.

## Divine Magic

Divine magic is a form of magic that can only be used and given by [gods](?entry=caster "Species") and [demigods](?entry=caster "Species"). Divine magic is the most powerful type of magic and takes a lot of concetration and energy to use. It is so powerful, in fact, that it can kill its users if not used carefully.

Divine magic works differently than other types of magic as it can be used in conjunction with other types. It can also be lost, unlike other types of magic, which stick with the user once learned.
