# Species

**Species** are the different entities and creatures, whether intelligent or not, that exist in the Cradia universe. Although there are thousands of animal, plant, and humanoid species that exist in the Craida universe, this page only covers a few important ones in regards to the universe's lore.

## Humanoid Species

Humanoid species are species that derive from or resemble humans. These species can also be referred to as anthro species for their humanlike qualities.

### Hierarchy

This table shows the hierarchy of humanoid species.

|Level |Species |Description
|:--: |:--:
|Divine |God <br> Demigod |Are some of the most powerful species.
|Magical |Caster |Have the ability to practice [magic](?entry=magic).
|Unmagical |Human <br> Elf |Are not magical biologically.

### Humans

Humans are the most basic humanoid species. They were also the only humanoid species created by [Order](?entry=order) when he created the universe. They generally do not have the ability to perform [magic](?entry=magic) with some exceptions. Not much is to be said about humans as they are very much like their counterpart in real life.

### Elves

Elves are very similar to humans and pose a lot of the same qualitites as them. So much so, that they are also able to reproduce with each other. Normal elves cannot preform [magic](?entry=magic), however, elves that can are considered to be casters. Unlike humans, elves have ponited ears, pale skin (whether light or dark), and either black, white, or light-blonde hair.

### Casters

Casters are a species (Humanoid or not) that are able to preform [magic](?entry=magic). Casters can be derived from humans, elves, etc. and can also reproduce with non-casters. As a caster becomes more in tune with magic, their blood begins to turn a dark blue. Casters can also live much longer than unmagical species, depending on how in tune they are with magic. Their lifespan can reach as high as thousands of years, however, most don't live this long because of the constant threats they recieve to their life.

### Demigods

Demigods are a mix between a human and a god. Demigods don't age, however they can be killed. Demigods can not be born and can only be created when a god is ripped of their godhood. Demigods are very powerful and can be as powerful as some gods. They are also very in tune with [magic](?entry=magic), which is the reason for their ability to not age. Demigods are able to practice any type of magic, including divine magic, other than [creation magic](?entry=magic#divine-magic), and have the ability to easily change their type of magic used with enough practice. Because of how in tune with magic demigods are, their blood is a dark purple instead of a dark blue. Currently, the only demigod that exists is [Order](?entry=order).

### Gods

Gods are the most powerful humanoid species and exist in a realm above the Cradia universe. They are so powerful that they can perform any type of [magic](?entry=magic) whenever they please, as well as transcend someone to godhood. Their blood color, most likely not red or blue, is unknown as they've never been seen bleeding, but it is suggested that it's color relates to their role as a god.
