    <strong>Kira Amaikoru</strong>, more commonly known as simply Kira is established as the acting godly figure in the Prince's Truth. Kira once lived in the kingdom of Canavar, though it isn't clearly stated if she was royal or not. The only other family member that's been mentioned so far is her twin sister whom is yet to be named.
  </p>
  <p>
    Kira throughout the book stays close with <a href="?entry=qatil-ikaru" title="Qatil Ikaru">Qatil Ikaru</a>, guiding him through a variety of situations whilst also attempting to explain to him what his true purpose should be. Kira was the one who assisted Qatil in unlocking his fire magic, although <a href="?entry=order" title="Order">Order</a> suggests she simply gave it to him. Such a thing was most likely done when she forced Ümid's blood down his throat when she stopped time at Canavar.

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
  <p>
    The revealed backstory in <a href="?entry=the-prince's-truth" title="The Prince's Truth">The Prince's Truth</a> is brief but it reveals that Kira was born in Canavar with an unspecified role in it's society, she was born with her twin sister and seemingly lived a happy life. Until <a href="?entry=order" title="Order">Order</a> filled her sisters head with hate and jealousy causing her to stab Kira in the back killing her. Once Kira had died Order had brought her soul to him and gifted her with half of his abilities, although Kira was furious with Order blaming him for ruining her life, thus she stole the rest of Order's power and casted him down to Cradia. She had attempted to destroy Cradia afterwards but later found out that Order in his last moments of power casted an unbreakable barrier around Cradia so that she couldn't destroy or alter anything or anyone of his creation.
  </p>
  <p>
    After Kira had dethroned <a href="?entry=order" title="Order">Order</a> of his godhood, pure chaos had appeared since the world was without Order, and so Kira made a plan she took a piece of her soul and merged it with pure chaos energy making a soul, the soul of whom would soon to be the god of chaos. Thus she went down to Cradia and found Sirus Ikaru, Qatils soon to be father and gave him the soul of chaos promising to assist him in taking over a kingdom in exchange for impregnating a powerful caster with the soul of chaos.

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
    <p>
        Throughout the book Kira's appearance remains unchanged, she has long pure white hair that reaches down to her waist, pale red irises, and extremely pale yet fair skin. This odd appearance is due to Kira being born with a condition called albinism. Kira is always depicted as wearing a silver toned silk robed with lilies embroidered across it. On her bare back is a prominent scar from being stabbed.

<h2>Personality</h2>
<div class="line-break"></div>

<div class="section">
    <p>
        When Kira first met <a href="?entry=qatil-ikaru" title="Qatil Ikaru">Qatil Ikaru</a> she put on a kind facade as she assisted Qatil in finding his way back to Ikarye when he was lost in the woods. At first Kira does seem kind as she tells Qatil where to find his twin sister and warns him of a coming omen in Canavar; although in reality this was far from just being kind acts. When Kira appeared to Qatil after Ümid had died she forced Ümid's blood down Qatil's throat practically telling him to ignore her death and only use the rage from it to destroy his enemies. In that moment Kira revealed her true colors, after that moment she became much more cynical and less lenient with Qatil's attempted positivity, telling him to ignore his friends problems and to focus on what she needed him to do for her.
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout part 3 Kira talks to <a href="?entry=qatil-ikaru" title="Qatil Ikaru">Qatil Ikaru</a> much more and through the conversations she did not put on any facade for him, she made it clear that she didn't care about anyone Qatil cared for, she didn't care that he was feeling bad about everything and everyone he was killing senselessly, she only cared that he did what she said. Although it is still apparent that Kira does care for Qatil to some extent although it isn't clear if it's because she needs him to destroy Order's barrier or because she's truly grown to care for him.
