## History

<!-- Put the kingdom's history here -->
In the beginning Ikarye wasn't always Ikarye, decades ago it wasn't even ruled by Sirus Ikaru. Originally it was a kingdom called Rukaria, it was a kingdom renowned for their humanitarianism, it was fair to even it's peasants and was more than happy to assist any neighboring kingdom in need. However one day Sirus himself rebelled against the orginal monarchy, rallying fellow citizens claiming that the actions of the king made the kingdom look weak and vulnerable to attack, he claimed that instead of helping other kingdoms they should show their strength so that they may not be tested. As the rebellion went on eventually Sirus would be victorious, he would then executre the former king and banish his family thus becoming the new king of the now newly named Ikarye. From then on he had done what he promised giving Ikarye the reputation of a very aggressive and heartless stronghold. Instead of herbal trade routes they now produced a variety of battle hardened warriors and casters, eventually leading to Ikarye being the most feared kingdom in the world which would cause the other kingdoms of Cradia nickname Ikarye "The Kingdom of the Dark."

The border of Ikary is a very thick and very tall nearly perfectly circular wall, within it's confines are various hosuings which are msot commonly occupied by the poor. Unlike most kingdoms who have separate areas for nobles and higher class individuals, Ikarye keep of their high profile individuals in the very large Ikarye castle, which is made of obsidion and red marble accented with gold, it's interior lacked many commonly used decorations such as paintings and decorative fruits, it had only the necesary furniture as if it were telling all who entered they would not be entertained. Due to this Half of Ikarye's confines is made up of peasant homes, and the other half is for farmlands and military training. At it's eastern borders many subterranian docks were built so that traders could discreetly take the river known as "Dark Beast Creek" to trade with Canavar.
