## Low Taper Fade

In chapter 47 of [The Prince's Truth](/the-prince's-truth), a paragraph centered around the [Low Taper Fade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(gamer)#Low_Taper_Fade "Low Taper Fade") meme could be seen for a very limited time. It was later removed and replaced with the book's canon chapter. Because of its short existance, the paragraph was not edited, resulting in poor sentence structure and grammar.

The main protagonist [Qatil Ikaru](/qatil-ikaru) asked his sister Möhnət Ikaru if she knew "what's crazy" and proceeded to try and convince her that the [Low Taper Fade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_(gamer)#Low_Taper_Fade "Low Taper Fade") meme was "still massive." Everyone soon began chanting "LOW TAPER FADE," including the people of Günəş. Shortly after, [Walter White](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_White_(Breaking_Bad) "Walter White (Breaking Bad)") stepped through a portal, as well as [Miles Morales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miles_Morales "Miles Morales") and the [Fantastic Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantastic_Four "Fantastic Four"). After a couple of jokes are cracked, [Martin Scorsese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Scorsese "Martin Scorsese") walked out of the same portal and said "Absolute cinema."

> Relieved my friends were ok I came closer to Mona and kneeled down to her and asked “You know what's crazy mona?” I paused for a bit to see if she'd know what I was talking about then finally spoke “That low taper fade meme is still massive, it's massive Mona.” Heyvan then stood up looking down at me with a smirk and asked “And you know what else is massive?” and as if we were a church choir we all yelled out in synch “LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW TAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADE.” Suddenly the surviving people of the kingdom began to make a tribal chant as they heard our cry all saying “LOW TAPER FADE LOW TAPER FADE LOW TAPER FADE LOW TAPER FADE.” Suddenly a magical portal opened up and Walter H. White walked out and said “I am the danger.” Soon Miles Morales spiderman came out of the portal too and said “What's up danger?” and finally the Fantastic Four came out of the portal and looked around, the thing then said “Wow this place is fantastic.” Then Mr. Fantastic turned to the thing and said “Say that again.” Finally Martin Scorsese came out of the portal and put his hands in the air and said “Absolute Cinema.”
