The **Chaos Orb** is a magical orb with chaos contained inside of it. It is made of a super strong glass-like material that allows the chaos inside to be seen swriling around. Because of this, the orb looks a fiery orange.

Currently, its purpose is unclear, and its lore has yet to be explored.

## Creation

The Chaos Orb was created during a battle between [Qatil Ikaru](/qatil-ikaru) and [Order](/order) in Günəş. The power of the two combined in a huge collision that formed the orb. It was taken by Order when the fight was finished.
