# Help

-# Welcome to the Cradia Wiki! Below are many topics that can help you if you get stuck.

## Navigation

* To begin learning about this wiki and the wonderful world of Cradia, visit the [home page](/home). From there, you can view the wiki's main pages, such as main characters, important places, cool topics, and much more!
* Don't just stop there! Most pages will contain light blue text that can take you to other pages when clicked. These can be used to learn even more about topics and gain context about certain pages.
* On the left side of the webpage (or on the bottom if you're on mobile) are other useful links that can take you to different parts of the wiki.
    * The "Main page" button will bring you back to the home page.
    * The "All pages" button will take you to a list of every page in the wiki. You can use this page to easily find other pages.
    * The "Random page" button will take you to—you guessed it—a random page. This is useful if you're interested in learning something new.
    * The "Help" button will take you to this page.

## Page Structure

* Pages about most topics will be similarly structured.
    * Subtopics are seperated by headings for cleaner and clearer navigation.
    * The right side of most pages will contain an infobox. They give basic information about the topic and can also contain links to other pages.
    * Some pages contain tables. These are used to easily organize structured information. On smaller devices, tables can be navigated horizontally.
